# Getting Started

## Installing

You can install reagraph with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reagraph) or Yarn.

```sh copy npm2yarn
npm install reagraph --save
```

## Compatibility

reagraph is compatible with React v16+ and works with ReactDOM. React Native is not supported at this time.

## Developing

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!
The project uses Storybook for its demos and development
environment. To run it locally:


<Steps>
### Clone repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:reaviz/reagraph.git
```

### Install dependencies
```sh copy npm2yarn
npm i
```

### Start the development server
```sh copy npm2yarn
npm run start
```
</Steps>

Once started the browser will open to the storybook url.
From here you can tweak the charts and see them build
and reload in real time.

We use Rollup to build and package for distribution.
You can run this by doing `npm run build` and it will
create a `dist` folder with the type definitions, bundled
javascript and css files.
